# ofxGpx

ofxGpx is an addon for openFrameworks to load GPX 1.1 format files. It is modeled to match the [GPX 1.1 Format Specification](http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/). Any extensions, included into the GPX file, are ignored.

All coordinates are being also converted into [Mercator projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) to be able to plot them into a x,y-based system.
